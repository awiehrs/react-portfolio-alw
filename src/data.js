    description: "Weather Memory is an app that will tell you what the weather was like when the user inputs any date from anywhere in the U.S., all the way back to 1970. As a fun bonus, it will also tell you the top hit on the billboard charts for that day. In addition, the design is responsive to the weather conditions for that day, so the user will notice clear blue skies when the weather was clear, cloudy skies on rainy days, and more. I worked on this project in a small group with two other developers.",

    description: "The Work Day Planner app is helpful to anyone working a 9am-5pm schedule and needs to keep track of their day. The user can input any task into the corresponding hour, and save their task in the event they need to close the app and come back to it later. During the hours of 9am-5pm, each hour block will change colors to indicate whether the hour has past, if it is currently that hour, or if the hour is upcoming.",

    description: "Eat Da Burger Diner is a full stack application made for pure entertainment. The design is set to remind you of a classical American diner menu, and you have the power to add to it! Once your desired burger is entered, the burger then appears on the 'Menu' with a 'Devour' button next to it. On the back end, the information is stored in a database and updated depending on whether you choose to devour the burger. Go ahead...eat da burger!",
